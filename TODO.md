# TODO
To-do list. 

## Organise
* Caculate metric for where species is on DD curve.
* Find out why high seed survival improves response to climate change.
* Re-fit Ricker and compare fit to Beverton-Holt.
* Re-write simulation code to include mean and variance on log scale (including pairing of climate values), and re-run simulations.
