# TODO
To-do list. 

## Organise
* Check that no GDD model was included in population sims. (May be misnomer - "GDD" model from 5th Dec doesn't actually have DD included; popsims previously reading in go_pars_tdistpois_naspecies_noerr_GDD_06Apr2016)
* Double-check reproduction prediction functions (calibration output graph is different).
* Recalculate medtraits for new GO parameters / simulations.
