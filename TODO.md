# TODO
To-do list. 

## Organise
* Add most recent version of *parametric* bootstrap file (and observation_error data).
* Combine and re-fit go models with parametric / non-parametric errors: poplevel_binomialG_tdistbpar_normndat, poplevel_lnpoistdist_BH_naspecies_diffnu_noerr_GDD_loglik
* Check that no GDD model was included in population sims. (May be misnomer - "GDD" model from 5th Dec doesn't actually have DD included; popsims previously reading in go_pars_tdistpois_naspecies_noerr_GDD_06Apr2016)
* Double-check reproduction prediction functions (calibration output graph is different).
