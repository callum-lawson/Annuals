# TODO
To-do list. 

## Organise
* Check whether can delete older versions of Venable master data.
* Write README for output files.
* Add most recent version of *parametric* bootstrap file (and observation_error data).
* Check that no GDD model was included in population sims. (May be misnomer - "GDD" model from 5th Dec doesn't actually have DD included)
* Check what seed_bank_sharedspecies csv file is.
